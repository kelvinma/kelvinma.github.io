Hi, I'm Kelvin, a Boston-based photojournalist.
During the week, you can find me roaming the campuses of Tufts University, where I am a staff photographer, or working a job for my various freelance clients.
When I'm not at work, you can probably find me running along the Charles River, riding my bike somewhere out in the burbs, working out with November Project, or cooking up something in my kitchen or at the grill.
To see a sampling of my work, check out my portfolio and blog!
